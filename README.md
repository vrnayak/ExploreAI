This repository contains various implementations &amp; applications of common AI algorithms. Listed below are the ones that are currently implemented

- `Simple Neural Classifier`: This AI algorithm is a feedforward neural network designed to solve classification tasks. I have applied this network to the classification of handwritten digits. After training the classifier on 60,000 images of handwritten digits in the MNIST database, this network achieved a 95% accuracy rate.
